# Project Meanbean Unity

## To build for Windows

Go to `File` -> `Build Settings`. Then select `PC, Mac, and Linux Standalone`. Make sure that your target platform is `Windows`. Then press `Build and Run`.

This should generate an executable (`.exe`) and a data folder. Both are needed in order to run the game.

## To build for Mac OSX

Go to `File` -> `Build Settings`. Then select `PC, Mac, and Linux Standalone`. Make sure that your target platform is `Mac OS X`. Then press `Build and Run`.

This should generate an application (`.app`). This can then be run. (You may need to change privacy settings to allow the run)

## To build for Linux

Go to `File` -> `Build Settings`. Then select `PC, Mac, and Linux Standalone`. Make sure that your target platform is `Linux`. Then press `Build and Run`.

This should generate an executable (`.x86`) and a data folder. Both are needed in order to run the game.

## To build for iOS

Go to `File` -> `Build Settings`. Then select `iOS`. Then press `Build and Run`.

This should generate a folder that can be used in XCode to run the application.

## To build for WebGL

Go to `File` -> `Build Settings`. Then select `WebGL`. Then press `Build and Run`.

This should generate a folder than can be used to integrate into the web. (This may a take a while to build)
